# Project Summary

Our group created Budget Buddy, a simple Python app that helps users track income and expenses. It calculates how much money is left or overspent each month.

# How It Works

budget_gui.py runs the main program and shows the GUI.

classes_project_9.py (in the library folder) handles all the math using classes.

The user enters income and expenses, and the program updates their balance automatically.

# What We Learned

We learned how to use Python classes, create a GUI, and use GitHub to organize and share code as a group.
